1. Simply run PentagoMain in your IDE (Requires Java SE 7 or later).

2. When prompted, enter your player name. The default AI name will be generated as 'Computer'.

3. Choose your marble color, enter 'b' or 'w' (Case does not matter)

4. Decide who moves first - enter '1' to have human player start, or '2' to have the computer start.
	- Any other input will default to computer starting first.

5. Enter your move in the format: [block]/[position] [block][direction]
	- 'block' is numbers 1 - 4, indicating quadrants in the board (1 top-left, 2 top-right, 3 bot-left, 4 bot-right).
	- 'position' is numbers 1-9, indicating location of marble in the specified block.
	- 'direction' is either 'R' or 'L', showing direction of block you wish to rotate.

6. Play the game until either a winner is declared, a tie, or the board fills up.
